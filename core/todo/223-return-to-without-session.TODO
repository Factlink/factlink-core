Places where return_to needs to be set:
 ☐ faulty login
 ☐ login because of routes authenticate(d) / devise
Social login:
 ☐ Set something before requesting the oauth
 ☐ retrieve the something after returning from oauth
 ☐ delete the something if oauth went wrong?
Cleanup:
 ☐ Remove places where session[:return_to] gets set (if possible)
