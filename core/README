# Start the local Solr development server:
rake sunspot:solr:start

# Manually index Solr. Objects get indexed on create/save, but sometimes
# it might come in handy to manually index Solr.
rake sunspot:index

Using vinova sunspot_mongoid. Requires customised rake sunspot:index:

### MESSAGE ###

Now, that doesn't work since those rake tasks are coupled to active 
record. To overcome this I added this file to my rails project: 
#lib/tasks/sunspot.rake 
namespace :sunspot do 
  desc "indexes searchable models" 
  task :index => :environment do 
    [list your models here].each {|model| Sunspot.index!(model.all)} 
  end 
end 
then you can do: 
rake sunspot:index
