 ✔ Figure out how to write a JS test @done (13-06-06 14:52)
 ☐ Write JS test verifying current behavior (test passes)
 ☐ Alter JS test to verify new behavior (text-area automatically grows as text is added) (test fails)
 ☐ Choose jquery plugin or other example implementing that feature (should be trivial)
 ☐ Implement & verify basic behavior
 ☐ Consider corner cases: what if text is deleted again, should textarea shrink?  Or when it loses focus?
