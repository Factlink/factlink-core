 ☐ Find out where to put JS tests (konacha?)
 ☐ Figure out how to write a JS test
 ☐ Write JS test verifying current behavior (test passes)
 ☐ Alter JS test to verify new behavior (text-area automatically grows as text is added) (test fails)
 ☐ Choose jquery plugin or other example implementing that feature (should be trivial)
 ☐ Implement & verify basic behavior
 ☐ Consider corner cases: what if text is deleted again, should textarea shrink?  Or when it loses focus?
