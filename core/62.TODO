Prework:
 ✔ Add a factrelation bottom @done (12-12-17 14:01)
 ✔ Decide which urls to use. @done (12-12-17 14:01)

Backend:
 ☐ make a command/interactor/route to add a subcomment to a factrelation
 ☐ make a command/interactor/route to add a subcomment to a comment
 ☐ make a query to retrieve subcomments on factrelations and comments and sort them
 ☐ make a interactor + route to expose this
   add a cannonical url to the json for delete/update actions
 ☐ make a 'comment' activity for the users that have interacted with the top comment/factrelation

Frontend:
 ☐ make a sub comments composite view, that has the top (factrelation/comment) subcomments collection as argument. (Composite becaust it contains a form + elements)
 ☐ Add a sub comments composite view to the factrelation
 ☐ Add a sub comments composite view to the top comment
 ☐ Add static models for testing to the collection
 ☐ Create a form for adding comments, that doesn't communicate with the backend
 ☐ Make styling equal to design.

Integration frontend:
 ☐ Remove the static models and use the resource url.
 ☐ Bind the form to the correct url.
 ☐ Make sure when removing a factrelation/comment with sub comments this isn't allowed to delete
 ☐ Create integration test
