  # This logic is to ensure a list of comments gets reloaded
  # when the user changes. For now this supports only changin
  # from non-logged in to logged in
  #
  # to ensure this also works when the currentuser is not yet fetched,
  # we allow username to be nil, even if we actually retrieve the
  # comments for a user. We just assume the backend knows better than the
  # frontend
  #
  # Limitations:
  #
  # * this does not support logging out yet
  # * potentially there could be raceconditions if login happens during fetching,
  #   but currently we don't see harmful raceconditions (worst case it refetches)
