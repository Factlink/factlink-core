<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Factlink we have a few fundamental principles:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We
    can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income
    level for no apparent reason.)
  </li>
  <li>
    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with
    the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
    on-going operation of one of our services.
  </li>
  <li>
    In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to
    control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private,
    and permanently deleted.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <%= link_to("contact us", pages_path("contact")) %>.
</p>
<p>
  Note: we’ve decided to adopt the privacy policy below adapted from the
  privacy policy of <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and
  Automattic Inc, which they graciously made available under a Creative
  Commons Sharealike license. Thanks Automattic!

<p>
  Factlink Inc. (“Factlink”) operates several websites including factlink.com
  and beta.factlink.com. It is Factlink’s policy to respect your privacy
  regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
</p>

<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

<p>
  Like most website operators, Factlink collects non-personally-identifying
  information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
  available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
  and the date and time of each visitor request. Factlink’s purpose in
  collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
  how Factlink’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Factlink may
  release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>

<p>
  Factlink also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
  comments on <a href="http://beta.factlink.com">beta.factlink.com</a> and
  <a href="http://factlink.com">factlink.com</a>. Factlink only discloses
  logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that
  it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below,
  except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the
  administrators of Factlink.
</p>

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>
  Certain visitors to Factlink’s websites choose to interact with Factlink in
  ways that require Factlink to gather personally-identifying information. The
  amount and type of information that Factlink gathers depends on the nature
  of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for at
  <a href="http://beta.factlink.com">beta.factlink.com</a> and
  <a href="http://factlink.com">factlink.com</a> to provide a username, an
  email address and optionally information they want to share with others like
  their name and location. Those who engage in transactions with Factlink are
  asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal
  and financial information required to process those transactions. In each
  case, Factlink collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
  appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
  Factlink. Factlink does not disclose personally-identifying information
  other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
  personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
  from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>

<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

<p>
  Factlink may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
  websites. For instance, Factlink may monitor the most popular channels on
  the <a href="http://factlink.com">factlink.com</a> site or use spam screened
  by Factlink to help identify spam. Factlink may display this information
  publicly or provide it to others. However, Factlink does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>
  Factlink discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on Factlink’s behalf or to provide
  services available at Factlink’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
  disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
  Factlink’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
  them. Factlink will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
  contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Factlink
  discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
  governmental request, or when Factlink believes in good faith that
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  Factlink, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
  of an Factlink website and have supplied your email address, apart of digest
  emails you might have subscribed to, Factlink may occasionally send you an
  email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep
  you up to date with what’s going on with Factlink and our products. We
  primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of
  information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you
  send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
  feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
  clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
  Factlink takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
  unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>
  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
  the visitor returns. Factlink uses cookies to help Factlink identify and
  track visitors, their usage of Factlink website, and their website access
  preferences. Factlink visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
  their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
  Factlink’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Factlink’s
  websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>

<h4>Business Transfers</h4>

<p>
  If Factlink, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the
  unlikely event that Factlink goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
  information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
  third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
  acquirer of Factlink may continue to use your personal information as set
  forth in this policy.
</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, Factlink may change its
  Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Factlink’s sole discretion.
  Factlink encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes
  to its Privacy Policy. If you have a
  <a href="http://factlink.com">factlink.com</a> account, you should also
  check your top-bar/dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use
  of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
  acceptance of such change.
