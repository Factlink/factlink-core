  <h1 class="on-your-site-content-heading">Discussion of the Week #2</h1>

  <p>While <%= link_to 'last week’s discussion', blog_discussion_of_the_week_1_path %> hardly resulted in a decisive answer, it did give some insights in arguments for and against. And that might just be what it is all about.</p>
  <p>So, another discussion this week. Because of the recent work-at-home controversy, we were wondering: what is actually more productive? Let’s discuss:</p>

  <span class="discussion-of-the-week-container">Working from home is more productive than working in an office.</span>

  <p>Again, don’t hesitate to join in, or sign up if you don’t have an account. And if you have any ideas for next week’s discussion, please leave a comment!</p>
