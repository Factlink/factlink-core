  <p>With Factlink, you can discuss any statement on the web. But the web is big! Therefore we are introducing the Discussion of the Week: a weekly discussion on a current topic.</p>
  <p>This week we are discussing exercising:</p>

  <span class="blog-discussion-of-the-week-container">It is best to exercise in the morning.</span>

  <p>Join the discussion by clicking the Factlink above!</p>

  <p>We will be expanding on this concept in the next couple of weeks. If you have ideas for topics to discuss, or how to further improve this concept, donâ€™t hesitate to leave a comment!</p>
