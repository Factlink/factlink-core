  <div class="publisher-content-area">
    <h1 class="publisher-content-heading">Higher engagement and retention</h1>
    <p>Creating an active community means more people visiting your site regularly. Even less frequent visitors will enjoy the lively debate within articles. When someone joins a discussion, we will update them on replies and other interesting discussions on your website. Jumping into the debate yourself gives your visitors the opportunity to discuss directly with the author.
