<h1>Supported browsers</h1>

<p>At this moment we officialy support Google Chrome and Firefox and Safari. We provide an extension for these browsers that adds a layer to the web, so you can immediately view and create Factlinks on a website.</p>

<h4>Unsupported browsers</h4>
<p>When we say that your browser is not supported, we mean that we can't guarantee that you will have the full experience of Factlink. This contains a website that is working like we think it should work and a browser extension so you can use Factlink at any time you want.</p>
