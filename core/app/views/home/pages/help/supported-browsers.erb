<h1>Supported Browsers</h1>

<p>At this moment we officialy only support Google Chrome. We've built a Chrome Extension that adds a layer to the web, so you can view at any time if there are Factlinks on a website or not.</p>

<h2>Unsupported browsers</h2>
When we say that your browser is not supported, we mean that we can't guarantee that you will have the full experience of Factlink. This contains a website that is working like we think it should work and a browser extension so you can use Factlink at any time you want.
