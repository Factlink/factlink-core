<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h4>What is Factlink?</h4>
<p>Factlink helps people understand how credible the information is that they’re reading. We’ve built a platform that lets you share what you know by creating Factlinks. By selecting any statement on the web and ‘attaching’ review information like supporting or weakening facts, you can share your knowledge.</p>
<p>Factlink is built on the belief that information should be openly shared, accessible, and transparent.</p>

<h4>How do I create a Factlink?</h4>
<p>This brief screencast will give you an overview on how to use Factlink:</p>
<%= render "home/pages/help/screencast" %>

<h4>Everywhere on the web</h4>
<p>You can create a Factlink by using one of our browser extensions (You can choose between Google Chrome and Firefox) or the Factlink Bookmarklet. These will enable the Factlink annotation mode on any website that you will visit. When enabled, creating a Factlink is as easy as selecting the text you want to Factlink and clicking the Factlink button.</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;">
  <li>The extension is enabled by default. Select your text and click the extension to Factlink.</li>
  <li>Enable the bookmarklet by clicking on it when you are on the page you want to Factlink</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the extension and Bookmarklet in the <b class="caret" style="margin: 7px 0 0;"></b> menu at the top right of this page.</p>

<!-- <h4>How do I follow someone?</h4>
<p>
We think it’s better to follow specific topics from persons instead of following persons. That is the reason why you can’t follow a person. You can follow a channel from someone by adding their channel to your own channel list.
</p> -->


<h4>How do I get authority?</h4>
<p>
Authority is gained by creating relevant and interesting Factlinks. When people interact more with your Factlinks you gain more authority.
