<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is Factlink?</h2>
<p>
Factlink helps people understand how credible the information is that they’re reading. We’ve built a platform that lets you add what you know by creating Factlinks. You can annotate any statement on the web and ‘attach’ review information, for instance supporting or weakening facts. The service is built on the belief that information should be openly shared, accessible, and transparent.

<h2>How do I create a Factlink?</h2>

<p>This brief screencast will give a overview on how to use Factlink:</p>
<%= render "home/pages/help/screencast" %>

<p>The <strong>easiest</strong> way to create a Factlink is by adding on directly to one of you channels. Select the channel you wish to add the Factlink to from the left column on the site. The input field at the top of the channel allows you to type in and post a new Factlink to this channel.</p>

<p>The <strong>coolest</strong> way to create a Factlink is by using our Chrome Extension or the Factlink Bookmarklet. These will enable the Factlink annotation mode on any website that you will visit. When enabled, creating a Factlink is as easy as selecting the text you want to Factlink and select your opinion.</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;">
  <li>The Chrome Extension is enabled by default. Select your text and click the extension to Factlink.</li>
  <li>Enable the bookmarklet by clicking on it when you are on the page you want to Factlink</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the Chrome Extension and Bookmarklet in the <b class="caret" style="margin: 7px 0 0;"></b> menu at the top right of this page.</p>

<h2>How do I install Factlink in my browser?</h2>

<p>When you are a Google Chrome user you can install our <a href="help/chrome-extension">Chrome Extension</a>. Once installed, simply annotate the text you want and click the extension. We have created also a <a href="help/chrome-extension">video</a> so you can watch how easy it is to create a Factlink.</p>

<p>For everyone else we made a special bookmarklet wich you can easily drag to your bookmarks bar. Simply click on it and annotate the text you want. The Factlink menu appears and you can give your opinion about the statement.</p>

<h2>How do I follow someone?</h2>
<p>
We think it’s better to follow specific topics from persons instead of following persons. That is the reason why you can’t follow a person. You can follow a channel from someone by adding their channel to your own channel list.
</p>


<h2>How do I get authority?</h2>
<p>
Authority is gained by creating relevant and interesting Factlinks. When people interact more with your Factlinks you gain more authority.
