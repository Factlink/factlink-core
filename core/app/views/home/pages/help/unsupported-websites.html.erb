<h1>Unsupported websites</h1>

<p>If you are visiting a website that is not supported by Factlink you will find a red square on the Chrome Extension on the top right corner of your browser, or a red exclamation mark in the Factlink Browser. This means that we have disabled the Factlink functionality for you to prevent the website from breaking.</p>

<p>Factlink might also be disabled on pages that could provide personal information, for example banking or email websites.</p>

<p>If you are visiting a website that is not working but should work with Factlink please contact us so we can try to make Factlink working on this website.</p>
