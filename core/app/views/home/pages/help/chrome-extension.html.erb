<h1>Chrome extension</h1>

<p>Google Chrome Extensions are applications that run inside the Chrome browser and provide additional functionality, integration with third party websites or services, and customized browsing experiences.</p>

<p>The Factlink Chrome Extension will enable you to use Factlink on virtually all websites you visit.</p>

<p>You can install our Chrome Extension from the <b class="caret" style="margin: 7px 0 0;"></b> menu in the top bar.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Since for Factlink to work we need to insert a Javascript on each site you visit, you get a warning that Factlink can access your data on all website. However, we only do two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Send the url you browse to to our server to check if any text is already Factlinked.</li>
  <li>Send text you factlink to our servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
