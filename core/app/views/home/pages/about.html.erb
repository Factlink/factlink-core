  <p>The new web inspires us to bring together the content of billions of users in one simple and elegant perspective that shows what people know.</p>
  <p>Factlink works on helping people understand how credible the information is that theyâ€™re reading. The service is built on the belief that information should be openly shared, accessible, and transparent.</p>
  <p>Factlink is located in both the San Francisco Bay Area and the Netherlands.</p>
