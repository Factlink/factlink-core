## Javascript Library

This project is the Javascript library. This is a set of javascript files which can be included on
any webpage. When included they enable Factlink functionality on the webpage

## Building

Just run:

```
make
```

## Using the functionality

This is currently done via the core unfortunately. Please see instructions for starting the core,
after running the run_env command, you can test via the web-proxy. Ideally we would want to start
a thin server from this app so we can develop independently, so that's a TODO ;)

## Running the tests

Run the tests via make:

```
make test
```

## Licensing

This project is closed source, (C) Factlink
